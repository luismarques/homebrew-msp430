homebrew-msp430
===============

This tap provides programming tools for MSP430, including GCC 4.6.3.

This is a fork of [tduehr/homebrew-msp430](https://github.com/tduehr/homebrew-msp430), which itself was based on [larsimmisch/avr](https://github.com/larsimmisch/homebrew-avr). The version by tduehr was declared deprecated due to MSP430 support having been added to mainline [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=e4a25868849c6594513a795a26be9da85b8b6ceb), but this formula is still useful to me (and maybe to you) because the main GCC formula has no support for cross-compiling (at the moment of this writing, at least).
